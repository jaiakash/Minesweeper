# Minesweeper
## Spider App Dev Task 2

Madhav, our resident genius, loves challenges and is yet to find one that
he couldn't crack. Many have tried their hand at making something that would
peg back Madhav but have only found failure yet. In comes our main man,
Gokul. He believes he can create a game, a version of a classic, that would
make Madhav struggle. Help him make an app with the following criteria to
stop the Madhav express.

LEVEL 1:

• Make a version of the Minesweeper game using canvas. <b>Done</b>

• Make an 8X8 grid and hard code mines in specific tiles in the grid. <b>Done</b>

• Stepping on a mine would lead to the end of the game and stepping on
safe grids would lead to an increment in the score. <b>Done</b>

• Make the device vibrate once you have stepped on a mine and signal
game over. <b>Done</b>

LEVEL 2:

• Randomize the location of the mines.

• Keep track of the high score, store it and display it accordingly. <b>Done</b>
